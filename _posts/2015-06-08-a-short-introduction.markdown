For this intro, I'm not going to do the usual "here's what you need to know about me" post. Instead, I want to preface a stream of thought I've been working on for the past couple of years as it has started to culminate in more than just thought and into possible direction. Many years ago, my dad impressed upon me the uselessness of simply reacting to something rather than providing direction for how change ought to be affected. I don't want us as a community to simply rage against change or the problems facing us. We are problem solvers at the core, so let's try to solve some things. I will likely start out reactionary, telling you what I think of how things are. As we move along, I will hopefully move more towards being constructive and instructive.
