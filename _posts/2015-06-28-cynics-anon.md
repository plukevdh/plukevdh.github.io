Hi, my name is Luke, and I'm a cynic.

I have a love/hate relationship with software. I think it's sort of a common thing in the industry. Lots of burnout and caremad on the internet, chronicling how bad some software can be. I am one of the people who often contributes to this cataloging of the Internet of Bad Software.

Software is a synthetic thing. It only exists because somebody sat down and wrote it. I like to believe you can do almost anything with software. It's a very malleable means of doing something. After all, it's just text in an editor. Very little is as easy to change as text in an editor. Partly because of this, it also tends to be very easy to break or make mistakes. Spellcheck is a thing for the same reason. There are lots of tools to help "spellcheck" code: Linters, compilers, static analysis. But "spellchecking" intent is much harder. But that's a discussion for another time.

I like to bash on bad software. It's so easy to do, especially when whatever it is, crashed, lost your work and made you mad. Criticism is easy. Becoming cynical of software on the whole is easy.

But easy is the fool's means to glory.

My dad taught me this lesson a long time ago, that criticism and reacting _against_ something only leads to destroying a thing without purpose. Sometimes things need to be destroyed. But in the end, if you define yourself by your ability to criticise and destroy something, you're left without identity once you accomplish that goal. Put another way, destroy "thing" while being "anti-thing", you have nothing left to define yourself by once "thing" is gone. Great examples of this were the swaths of "The Next Facebook" or "Anti-Facebook" clones that came out and are still being developed. While Facebook has been rumored to be in decline in recent history, there are still no major players making even marginal gains. Ello is a perfect example of this. They built up out of a desire to "not be that social network that collects all your data and sells it to advertisers". Every major publicity gaffe Facebook has made recently (alias profiles, timeline manipulation, etc), Ello has responded with some Guy Fawkes-esque email railing against the establishment (i.e. Facebook). But what are they but another Facebook that is simply "not Facebook"?
