Hi. I'm Luke. I've been writing code since 2001 and developing professionally since 2009. I have lots of thoughts, some of which spill over here. Hopefully some of this leads me somewhere meaningful in terms of how I want to see software designed and written in the future. Maybe you'll get inspired too.

Language is not important. Solving important problems in the people space is. I want to make life easier for people, namely developers, mostly because I am one too.

Thanks for reading either way.
